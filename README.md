Implementation of sporadic finite subgroups of SL(3,C) in Magma\
You can try running the code using the Magma calculator at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ \
This code for Magma should allow the user to implement the finite subgroups E through L of SL(3,C)\
which are described in the classification given by S.Yau and Y.Yu in their 1993 work\
Gorenstein Quotient Singularities in Dimension Three.\
It is hoped that the user may find this useful in case they wish to further study these\
particular groups.\
For example, the McKay quiver of any of these groups (with respect to your favourite representation)\
can be computed with relative ease from the character table data.\
