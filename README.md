Implementation of sporadic finite subgroups of SL(3,C) in Magma\
You can try running the code using the Magma calculator at http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ \
This code for Magma allows the user to construct and experiment with\
the finite subgroups E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L of SL(3,C)\
which are described in the classification given by S.Yau and Y.Yu\
in [Gorenstein Quotient Singularities in Dimension Three, 1993].\
It is hoped that the user may find this useful in case they wish to further study these particular groups,\
or simply as an elementary introduction to the Magma computer algebra system.

This repository includes:
- A file containing three functions which construct the groups in question.
- A file containing sample code for experimenting with finite groups in Magma.\
  In particular, once constructed, the adjacency matrix for the McKay quiver of a group 
  (with respect to a given representation) can be computed from character table data.
- A file containing the source code from the above two all in one file
  for the purpose of improving/impeding the ease of reading and use
- Character table outputs from running the code in the Magma calculator
- A licence
- This README file

Thanks to Prof. Miles Reid at the University of Warwick for supervising me on this\
Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS) in the summer of 2015,\
and thanks to the University of Warwick for providing the URSS bursary\
of Â£1000 to support this research.
